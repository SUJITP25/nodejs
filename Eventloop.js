// Javascript is synchronous, blocking and single-theraded language.
// To make aync programming possible, we need the help of libuv.
// memory heap - All declared variables and functions resides here. 
// callstack - Whenever we execure code, functions are pushed into the call stack.
// Execution is done in LIFO manner, lastInFirstOut, stack Data Structure.
